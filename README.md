## Questions

1. Write the function weeblyFloat() (in Javascript) that given a string will return a float value for that string. Do not use parseFloat() or cast directly to a Number.

2. Given an array with a mix of strings and other arrays (of strings and/or arrays), flatten it into a single array of strings using the programming language of your choice. 

3. There is a search box on a page that populates search results as a user types. Queries are intensive, so we donâ€™t want to search on every keypress unless there is a reasonable pause.
